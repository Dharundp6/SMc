## 2. createProject
Description: Allows the owner to create a new sustainable project with a funding goal.
Input Parameters:
_goalAmount: The funding goal for the project.
Events:
ProjectCreated(uint256 indexed projectId, uint256 goalAmount): Emitted when a new project is created.

# 3. invest
Description: Allows individuals to make micro-investments in a project.
Input Parameters:
_projectId: The ID of the project to invest in.

ProjectFunded(uint256 indexed projectId): Emitted when a project is fully funded.

# 4. withdrawFunds
Description: Allows the project owner to withdraw funds after a project is funded.
Input Parameters:
_projectId: The ID of the project to withdraw funds from.
Requirements:
The project must not be active.

## Deployment and Usage
-Deploy the Micro-Investment Platform smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
-Specify the address of the ERC20 token that will be used for investments.
-The contract owner can create new sustainable projects with funding goals.
-Individuals can invest in active projects by specifying the project ID and the amount they wish to invest.
-When a project reaches its funding goal, it becomes inactive, and the owner can withdraw the funds.
-Investors can check their individual investments in specific projects using the getInvestment function.

## Security Considerations
-Ensure that the contract owner is a trusted entity as they have control over project creation and fund withdrawal.
-Conduct thorough testing and security audits before deploying the contract on the Ethereum mainnet.
-Implement access controls and ensure that only authorized users can call specific functions.
-Follow best practices for secure coding and contract development.
